              The divergence of the Q-value estimation has been a prominent issue offline reinforcement learning (offline RL), where the agent has no access to real dynamics. 
              Traditional beliefs attribute this instability to querying out-of-distribution actions when bootstrapping value targets. 
              Though this issue can be alleviated with policy constraints or conservative Q estimation, a theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanism causing the divergence has been absent. 
              In this work, we aim to thoroughly comprehend this mechanism and attain an improved solution. 
              We first identify a fundamental pattern, self-excitation, as the primary cause of Q-value estimation divergence in offline RL. 
              Then, we propose a novel Self-Excite Eigenvalue Measure (SEEM) metric based on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to measure the evolving property of Q-network at training, which provides an intriguing explanation of the emergence of divergence. 
              For the first time, our theory can reliably decide whether the training will diverge at an early stage, and even predict the order of the growth for the estimated Q-value, the model's norm, and the crashing step when an SGD optimizer is used. 
              The experiments demonstrate perfect alignment with this theoretic analysis. 
              Building on our insights, we propose to resolve divergence from a novel perspective, namely improving the model's architecture for better extrapolating behavior. 
              Through extensive empirical studies, we identify LayerNorm as a good solution to effectively avoid divergence without introducing detrimental bias, leading to superior performance. 
              Experimental results prove that it can still work in some most challenging settings, i.e. using only 1% transitions of the dataset, where all previous methods fail. 
              Moreover, it can be easily plugged into modern offline RL methods and achieve SOTA results on many challenging tasks. We also give unique insights into its effectiveness.

    In our paper, we theoretically prove that Q-value divergence happens when <b>the maximal eigenvalue of the following matrix \(A_t\) (namely SEEM)</b> is greater to 0:
		<figure style="text-align: center;">
          <img id="teaser" width="60%" src="images/seem_eqn.jpg">  
      </figure>
    \(A_t\) is determined by a discount factor \(\gamma\) and the NTK between \(X\) and \(X^*_t\), where \(X\) is the vector composed of the state-action pairs \((s, a)\) in the offline dataset. 
    \(X^*_t\) is the vector of the state-action pairs \((s^\prime, \pi_{\theta_t}(s^\prime))\) dependent on policy \( \pi_{\theta_t}\). The NTK matrix depicting the strength of the bond between \(X\) and \(X^\prime\) due to generalization is defined as 
    \(G_{\theta_t}(X,X^\prime)=\phi_\theta(X)^T \phi_\theta(X^\prime)\), where \(\phi_\theta(X):=\nabla_\theta Q_\theta(X)\).
    </p><p>
        <b>The intuitive interpretation for SEEM is as below: </b>
           If SEEM is positive, the generalization bond between \(Q_\theta(X)\) and \(Q_\theta(X^*_t)\) is strong. 
          When updating the value of \(Q_\theta(X)\) towards \(r+\gamma Q_\theta(X^*)\), due to strong generalization of the neural network, the Q-value iteration inadvertently makes \(Q_\theta(X^*)\) increase even more than the increment of \(Q_\theta(X)\).
          Consequently, the TD error \(r+\gamma Q_\theta(X^*) - Q_\theta(X)\) expands instead of reducing, due to the target value moving away faster than predicted value, which encourages the above procedure to repeat. 
          This forms a positive feedback loop and causes self-excitation. Such mirage-like property causes the modelâ€™s parameter and its prediction value to diverge.

                In essence, a large SEEM value arises from the improper link between the dataset inputs and out-of-distribution data points. The MLP without normalization demonstrates abnormal behavior that  the value predictions of the dataset sample and extreme points at the boundary have large NTK value and exhibit a strange but strong correlation. <b>This indicates an intriguing yet relatively under-explored approach to avoid divergence: regularizing the modelâ€™s generalization on out-of-distribution predictions.</b>
                Therefore, a simple method to accomplish this would be to insert a LayerNorm prior to each non-linear activation. 
                We provide theoretical justification explaining why LayerNorm results in a lower SEEM value in the supplementary material of our paper.

             <li>Policy constraint (BC) is unable to control q-value divergence while performing well in some challenging environments. When the policy constraint is weak (BC 0.5), it initially achieves a decent score, but as the degree of off-policy increases, the value starts to diverge, and performance drops to zero. Conversely, when the policy constraint is too strong (BC 10), the learned policy cannot navigate out of the maze due to suboptimal data, and performance remains zero. In contrast, simply incorporating LayerNorm into Diff-QL, our method ensures stable value convergence under less restrictive policy constraints (BC 0.5). This results in consistently stable performance in the challenging Antmaze-large-play task.</li>

           <li>Online RL Experiments - LayerNorm Allows Online Methods without EMA. It is natural to ask whether our analysis and solution are also applicable to online settings. Previous works has empirically or theoretically shown the effect of EMA in stabilizing Q-value and prevent divergence in online setting. To answer the question, We tested whether LayerNorm can replace EMA to prevent value divergence. Surprisingly, we discovered that LayerNorm solution allows the SAC without EMA to perform equivalently well as the SAC with EMA.

                In this paper, we propose an eigenvalue measure called SEEM to reliably detect and predict the divergence. Based on SEEM, we proposed an orthogonal perspective other than policy constraint to avoid divergence, by using LayerNorm to regularize the generalization of the MLP neural network. <b>Moreover, the SEEM metric can serve as an indicator, guiding future works toward further engineering that may yield adjustments with even better performance than the simple LayerNorm. 
                We hope that our work can provide a new perspective for the community to understand and resolve the divergence issue in offline RL. </b>

First, pay attention to the weather conditions, as sudden changes in weather, especially strong winds or storms, can cause the water to become rough and pose risks to the stability of the pier. Second, be mindful of the structural integrity of the pier; avoid overloading it with too many people or excessive weight, as this could potentially damage the pier or cause it to collapse. Additionally, be aware of the surrounding wildlife and respect their space; do not harm or disturb them in any way. Finally, if you decide to go fishing, ensure that you adhere to any local fishing regulations and use appropriate fishing techniques to keep the lake ecosystem healthy and maintain the balance of the food chain.â€‹â€‹"],

The pier extending over the calm water provided an excellent vantage point from which to appreciate the breathtaking scenery. As I stood on the pier, I couldn't help but feel a deep connection with nature, taking a moment to soak in the peaceful atmosphere.â€‹

One of the highlights of my trip was undoubtedly the fishing experience. The area is teeming with life, and I was thrilled to land a sizeable catch, despite the modest size of the lake. The joy of fishing in such a beautiful setting was truly rewarding, and it allowed me to take a break from my busy life and truly immerse myself in the tranquility of nature.â€‹

While exploring the surrounding area, I came across a family of birds that had built a nest close to the pier, adding to the charm of the location. Interacting with the wildlife and observing their behavior was an enriching experience that I'll cherish for years to come.â€‹

In conclusion, this idyllic destination provided me with an opportunity to unwind and recharge, surrounded by mesmerizing natural beauty and the gentle sounds of water and wildlife. If you're looking for a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, this pier overlooking the lake is the perfect place to find solace and reconnect with nature.`
